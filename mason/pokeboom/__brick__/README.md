## Technical stack

### Flutter

The app is developed in Flutter. More info on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)
The app can run on [several platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms).

#### Flutter Channels

We must use as much as possible the channel "stable" for production deliveries.
We can switch to "beta" to use a recent feature, or to fix a problem not released on "stable"
However, we should never use "master" or "dev" channels.

More information here : [Flutter channels](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade#switching-flutter-channels)

### Architecture

This project uses Riverpod for state management and Clean Architecture.
Here is the [Riverpod documentation](https://riverpod.dev/).
